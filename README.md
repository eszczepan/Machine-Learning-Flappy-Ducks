# Machine Learning Flappy Ducks using NEAT

Machine Learning Flappy Ducks implements a machine learning algorithm in the "Flappy Ducks" (based on original game called "Flappy Birds") video game using neural networks and a genetic algorithm.
Main goal of the game is to avoid pipes sticking out from above and below by the duck.

The project demonstrates the use of neuroevolution to generate agents that can make decisions to survive with the help of artificial intelligence in a generated environment with obstacles.
As part of the work, an appropriately extended genetic algorithm was implemented, which was incorporated into a training system.

All the code was written in JavaScript using libraries:

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - a library that facilities drawing objects in the browser, has full set of drawing functions,
- [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - a library for creating machine learning models that can be used in the browser or node.js.
